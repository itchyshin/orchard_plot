# IMPORTANT NOTE: `orchaRd` has now moved to a new site where it is being actively developed: https://github.com/daniel1noble/orchaRd

[`orchaRd` 2.0](https://github.com/daniel1noble/orchaRd) can now take meta-regression models with a multitude of different predictor variables, produce marginal means, deal with heteroscedastic errors and even now produce bubble plots with continuous moderators.
